# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio ! Here is my showcase of selected projects from my Master of Data Science program, and from outside projects.

## Projects

1. [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/student_performance)  
   Developed a hybrid machine learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Means clustering to categorize students based on academic performance and behavioural indicators. Produced predictive insights to guide early educational interventions, and demonstrated the role of AI in supporting data-informed decision-making within complex social and learning environments.

2. [COâ‚‚ Emissions Analysis by Vehicle Class](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/co2)  
   Applied statistical modeling techniques, including regression and ANOVA, alongside exploratory data analysis to examine the relationship between vehicle class, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions. 


3.  [Customs Clearance Optimization Using AI](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/customs_optimization)   
   Simulated and evaluated customs clearance routing efficiency using AI-based optimization techniques, comparing between A* Search and Genetic Algorithms. The model incorporated factors like shipment risk, document accuracy, and clearance delays to reflect real-world constraints. This project demonstrates how transport system modeling and data-driven route optimization can be applied to enhance operational efficiency in intelligent transportation systems and cross-border logistics planning.

5. [Simulated Spotify Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/music_streaming)   
   Analyzed music streaming data to uncover genre trends, popularity patterns, and user preferences. Conducted performance comparisons between SQL and Python-Spark (PySpark) to evaluate the effectiveness of conventional vs. big data processing techniques. The project emphasizes scalable analytics, real-time insights, and behavioural modeling in digital content ecosystems.
   
6. [Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machines](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/predictive-maintenance)  
   Built a machine learning model to classify five types of mechanical failures using high-frequency sensor data. Demonstrated the potential of predictive analytics to minimize downtime and extend equipment lifespan. This project showcases risk monitoring, and intelligent asset maintenance strategies.

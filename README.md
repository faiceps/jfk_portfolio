# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio ! Here is my showcase of selected projects from my Master of Data Science program, and from outside projects.

## Projects

1. [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/student_performance)  
   A hybrid machine learning model using CNN + K-Means to identify at-risk students and enable early intervention strategies.

2. [COâ‚‚ Emissions Analysis by Vehicle Class](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/co2)  
   Performed regression, ANOVA and EDA in R to explore how vehicle types and fuel usage impact emissions.

3. [Simulated Spotify Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/predictive-maintenance)   
   Performed comparative analysis on song popularity and genre trends using MySQL and PySpark, highlighting performance and syntax differences between conventional and Big Data processing tools.
   
4. [Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machines](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/music_streaming)  
   Built a failure prediction model on sensor data to classify five machine failure types.

# # ðŸš— Analyzing COâ‚‚ Emissions Across Vehicle Classes

This project uses R to explore the environmental impact of automotive vehicles based on fuel consumption and vehicle type. Through statistical modeling and visualization, we identify key predictors of COâ‚‚ emissions and assess how different vehicle classes contribute to environmental load.

## Dataset Info
- **Name**: `co2_emmision_train_data.csv`
- **Source**: [Kaggle CO2 Emissions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Size**: ~27,549 rows Ã— 26 columns
- **Content**: Vehicle specifications including:
  - Fuel consumption (City, Highway, Combined)
  - COâ‚‚ emissions (g/km)
  - Vehicle Class (e.g. SUV, Pickup Truck, Mid-size)
  - Engine size, transmission type, and more

---

## Objectives
1. Investigate how **driving conditions** (city vs. highway) affect **fuel efficiency** and **COâ‚‚ emissions**.
2. Examine whether **vehicle class** significantly influences COâ‚‚ output.
3. Identify the **strongest predictors** of emissions and evaluate model fit.

## Methods & Techniques
### Data Cleaning
- Removed invalid `COâ‚‚ = 0` values.
- Replaced missing city/combined fuel values using highway fuel data.
- Consolidated similar vehicle class labels (e.g., all SUV variants into "SUV").

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Histograms, density plots, Q-Q plots
- Correlation matrix using `corrplot`
- Boxplots comparing emissions by vehicle type

### Statistical Modeling
- **One-Sample T-Test**: Validated emissions > 0 baseline
- **Two-Sample T-Test**: Compared emissions between high and low fuel consumption groups
- **ANOVA**: Tested variance in COâ‚‚ across vehicle classes
- **Linear Regression Models**:
  - Model 1: COâ‚‚ ~ Vehicle Class â†’ *RÂ² = 0.17*
  - Model 2: COâ‚‚ ~ Combined Fuel Consumption â†’ *RÂ² = 0.83*

### Diagnostic Analysis
- Residuals vs. Fitted plots
- Scale-Location plots
- Q-Q plots
- Leverage plots



## Key Insights
- Vehicles with **higher combined fuel consumption emit significantly more COâ‚‚**.
- **Fuel consumption is a stronger predictor** of emissions than vehicle class.
- Among all types, **Pickup Trucks** and **Two-Seaters** contribute the highest emissions per unit of fuel.
- Linear regression using `Combined Fuel Consumption` explains **83.5%** of variance in COâ‚‚ emissions (RÂ² = 0.83), compared to only 16.5% using `Vehicle Class`.

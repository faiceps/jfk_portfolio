**This project uses both MySQL and Python-Spark (PySpark) to investigate musical trends, song characteristics, and listener preferences using a simulated Big Data-scale Spotify dataset containing 50,000 records. The goal is to compare the performance and insights obtained from a conventional tool and a Big Data tool for real-time, large-scale business analytics.**

## Objectives
- What are the musical features that contribute to a song's popularity?
- Which genre(s) are dominant in which period(s) of time?
- How can advanced analytics optimize a recommender system to increase user engagement and platform growth?

---

## Key Findings

- ‘Electronic’, ‘Pop’, and ‘Hip-Hop’ are **top genres that dominate total streams by volume**.

- 'Reggae', 'R&B', and 'Folk' lead in **average streams per song**, despite having fewer songs being released in these genres, **showing popularity** in these genres.

- Streaming volume spiked upwards from year 2000 onwards, showing **global adoption** of music streaming platforms.

- ‘Electronic’ **appears consistently among top genres across years**, implying cross-generational appeal.

- **PySpark outperformed MySQL** in Big Data datasets with compute-intensive tasks, enabling real-time analytics and scalable insights that support business intelligence solutions.

### Business Action Recommendations:

- Use high-engagement genres like Electronic, Pop, Hip-Hop in advertisements, events, and radio to boost user attention.

- Promote niche genres like Folk, Classical, Jazz through personalized playlists to attract and retain new users.

- Enhance user discovery by recommending underplayed songs in strong-performing genres.

## Methods & Techniques

### MySQL
- Performed aggregation, filtering, and grouping querings by genre and year to reveal trends and top-performing genres.

### PySpark 
- Utilized Spark DataFrames for scalable transformations, grouped aggregations, and optimized filtering for high-volume data handling.

### Comparative Analysis
- Benchmarked MySQL vs. PySpark on runtime performance, scalability with increasing data size, and analytical accuracy.

### Business Intelligence
- Extracted actionable insights to inform content strategy, audience targeting, and genre-based marketing recommendations.

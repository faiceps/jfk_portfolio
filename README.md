# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio ! Here is my showcase of selected projects from my Master of Data Science program, and from outside projects.

## Projects

1. 🧠 [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/student-performance)  
   A hybrid machine learning model using CNN + K-Means to identify at-risk students and enable early intervention strategies.

2. 🚗 [CO₂ Emissions Analysis by Vehicle Class](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/co2)  
   Performed regression, ANOVA and EDA in R to explore how vehicle types and fuel usage impact emissions.

3. 🏭 [Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machines](https://github.com/faiceps/jfk_portfolio/tree/predictive-maintenance)  
   Built a failure prediction model on sensor data to classify five machine failure types.
